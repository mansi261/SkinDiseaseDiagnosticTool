# SkinDiseaseDiagnosticTool
Skin Disease Detection using Image Processing using Multi Modal CLIP model

Prerequisites :
Execute embeddings scripts in python 3.9 or above virtual environment and install compatible version of libabries mentioned in the notebook 


1. Dataset requirements : 
 The dataset used in this notebook is under `/Dataset` folder , if you want tot train on different dataset ensure dataset is image-text pair  and if classification needs to be performed images have classification classes as well

2. Embeddings : 
The `/Embeddings` code contain scripts to generate embedings using Clip and Resent50 model 
3. Image Classifcation , step is optional .The scripts are present in `/nine_partition folder`
4. `/Final Notebook` contains link to access notebook will  complete  execution and also demonstrates use cases.
